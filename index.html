      <p><em>Summary of user needs and motivating questions.</em></p>

      <p><em>Expectation: There is a clear focus, and a developed explanation of

      <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
      <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>
      <p>
				We collected three datasets from the USDT Bureau of Transportation
				Statistics and one dataset from a survey of Chester Square residents.
				The following descriptions match the data used for our visualization.
				Original datasets may have included aggregates or other fields which
				were not relevant to our investigation. Any data encoded as a number
				of thousands or other unusual scale was transformed to normal decimal
				numbers.
				<dl>
					<dt>Survey Data</dt>
					<dd>2019 transit and vehicle usage and quality of experience for the
					Chester Square neighborhood.</dd>
					<dd>We distributed a Google Forms survey to residents of Chester
					Square via the Chester Square Neighborhood Association and received
				  twenty responses. The data for buses and trains contains frequency of
				  use, opinion on whether the number of stops and frequency of services
				  are sufficient, and opinion on crowding. Data for vehicles contains
				  the number of vehicles owned, use frequency, and opinion on traffic
					quality.</dd>
					<dd>This dataset displays in the Chester Square Overview bar.</dd>

					<dt>Commute Types</dt>
					<dd>2013 work commute types by state.</dd>
					<dd>This dataset provides the number of workers for each state along
					with a breakdown of workers' transportation methods by percent. Modes
					of transportation are encoded as driving alone, carpooling, using
				  public transit, walking, taking other means, or working at home.</dd>
					<dd>This dataset is selectable in the dropdown data selection menus
					and	displays on the parallel coordinates chart and choropleth.</dd>
					<dd>Accessed at: <a href="https://www.bts.gov/content/commuting-work">
					bts.gov</a></dd>
					<dd>Notes from source: Data for workers age 16 years and over, based
					on state of residence.</dd>

					<dt>Urban Transit Ridership</dt>
					<dd>2013 urban transit ridership by state and transit mode.</dd>
					<dd>This dataset contains the number of unlinked passenger trips per
					state along with a percentage breakdown of ridership for each cagegory
				  of transit - bus, heavy rail, light rail, commuter rail, and other.
					Unlinked passenger trips are defined as a trip on urban	transit which
					has beginning and end but which is not linked to a person. Counts of
					unique passengers are not derivable from this data,	and transit rides
					with multiple legs may be recorded as multiple trips. The notes below
					from the data source explain the categories of transit.</dd>
					<dd>This dataset is selectable in the dropdown data selection menus
					and	displays on the parallel coordinates chart and choropleth.</dd>
					<dd>Accessed at: <a href="https://www.bts.gov/content/urban-transit-ridership-state-and-transit-mode">
					bts.gov</a></dd>
					<dd>Notes from source: This table includes data from urban transit
					agencies that are required to report information to the federal
					government because they applied for or are direct beneficiaries of
					urbanized area formula grants (49 USC 5307). Beginning in 2012, data
					include estimated industry totals for agencies with a Small Systems
					Waiver in place and Rural reporters. Data are assigned to the state
					of a transit agency's mailing address.  Details may not add to
					totals due to rounding. Light rail includes light rail, street car,
					and hybrid rail modes. Motorbus includes motorbus, commuter bus, and
					bus rapid transit. Other includes automated guideway, cable car,
					demand response, ferry boat, inclined plane, monorail, trolley bus,
					and van pool.</dd>

					<dt>Motor Bus Transit Route Milage</dt>
					<dd>2013 motor bus transit route mileage by state, for different
					rights-of-way.</dd>
					<dd>This dataset contains the number of directional route-miles for
					buses in each states, broken down into three different rights-of-way.
					The notes below from the data source explain the different
					rights-of-way and define directional route-miles.</dd>
					<dd>This dataset is selectable in the dropdown data selection menus
					and	displays on the parallel coordinates chart and choropleth.</dd>
					<dd>Accessed at: <a href="https://www.bts.gov/content/motor-bus-transit-route-mileage">
					bts.gov</a></dd>
					<dd>Notes from source: Motor bus includes commuter bus, bus, bus rapid
					transit, and trolleybus. Directional route-miles is the mileage in
					each direction over which public transportation vehicles travel while
					in revenue service.  Directional route-miles are a measure of the
					facility or roadway, not the service carried on the facility, such as
					the number of routes or vehicle-miles.  Directional route-miles are
					computed with regard to direction of service, but without regard to
					the number of traffic lanes or rail tracks existing in the
					right-of-way. Exclusive right-of-way refers to lanes reserved at all
					times for transit use and other high occupancy vehicles (HOVs).
					Controlled right-of-way refers to lanes restricted for at least a
					portion of the day for use by transit vehicles and other HOVs. Mixed
					right-of-way refers to lanes used for general automobile traffic.
					Route-miles are assigned to the state of the transit agency's
					headquarters.</dd>

				<em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are
					appropriate. These descriptions should be very explicit so someone
					could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em>
			</p>

      <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

      <p><em>Summary of task table.</em></p>

      <p>
				<em>Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and
				  abstract tasks for domain problems.</em>
			</p>

      <h1>Design Process</h1>

      <p>
				<em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em>
			</p>

      <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
      Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
      Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>


      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p><em>Short summary of work completed and areas for
				 improvement/future-work.</em></p>

      <p><em>Expectation: Meaningfully wraps up project and has good future
				 directions.</em></p>
