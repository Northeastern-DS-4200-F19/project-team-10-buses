			<h1>Motivation</h1>

			<p>It is very unclear how the experience of public transport is for
				the passengers and how it is compare to the rest of the America. 
				We can hear complain from people around us, but we need a research 
				and data visualization to find out the best solution to improve 
				the public transport system. Knowing the passengers opinions and
				the difference patterns between Boston and other states can 
				benefit on improving the users experience. And also, by providing
				good visualization comparisons, we can know the position Massachusetts 
				public transport is at among other States and to conclude the good 
			and bad of Boston public transport.</p>

			<p><em>Summary of user needs and motivating questions.</em></p>

			<p><em>Expectation: There is a clear focus, and a developed explanation of
			the problem, and a reasonable response is proposed.</em>

			<h1>Data Analysis</h1>
			<p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>
			<p>
				We collected three datasets from the USDT Bureau of Transportation
				Statistics and one dataset from a survey of Chester Square residents.
				The following descriptions match the data used for our visualization.
				Original datasets may have included aggregates or other fields which
				were not relevant to our investigation. Any data encoded as a number
				of thousands or other unusual scale was transformed to normal decimal
				numbers.
				<dl>
					<dt>Survey Data</dt>
					<dd>2019 transit and vehicle usage and quality of experience for the
					Chester Square neighborhood.</dd>
					<dd>We distributed a Google Forms survey to residents of Chester
						Square via the Chester Square Neighborhood Association and received
						twenty responses. The data for buses and trains contains frequency of
						use, opinion on whether the number of stops and frequency of services
						are sufficient, and opinion on crowding. Data for vehicles contains
						the number of vehicles owned, use frequency, and opinion on traffic
					quality.</dd>
					<dd>This dataset displays in the Chester Square Overview bar.</dd>

					<dt>Commute Types</dt>
					<dd>2013 work commute types by state.</dd>
					<dd>This dataset provides the number of workers for each state along
						with a breakdown of workers' transportation methods by percent. Modes
						of transportation are encoded as driving alone, carpooling, using
					public transit, walking, taking other means, or working at home.</dd>
					<dd>This dataset is selectable in the dropdown data selection menus
					and	displays on the parallel coordinates chart and choropleth.</dd>
					<dd>Accessed at: <a href="https://www.bts.gov/content/commuting-work">
					bts.gov</a></dd>
					<dd>Notes from source: Data for workers age 16 years and over, based
					on state of residence.</dd>

					<dt>Urban Transit Ridership</dt>
					<dd>2013 urban transit ridership by state and transit mode.</dd>
					<dd>This dataset contains the number of unlinked passenger trips per
						state along with a percentage breakdown of ridership for each cagegory
						of transit - bus, heavy rail, light rail, commuter rail, and other.
						Unlinked passenger trips are defined as a trip on urban	transit which
						has beginning and end but which is not linked to a person. Counts of
						unique passengers are not derivable from this data,	and transit rides
						with multiple legs may be recorded as multiple trips. The notes below
					from the data source explain the categories of transit.</dd>
					<dd>This dataset is selectable in the dropdown data selection menus
					and	displays on the parallel coordinates chart and choropleth.</dd>
					<dd>Accessed at: <a href="https://www.bts.gov/content/urban-transit-ridership-state-and-transit-mode">
					bts.gov</a></dd>
					<dd>Notes from source: This table includes data from urban transit
						agencies that are required to report information to the federal
						government because they applied for or are direct beneficiaries of
						urbanized area formula grants (49 USC 5307). Beginning in 2012, data
						include estimated industry totals for agencies with a Small Systems
						Waiver in place and Rural reporters. Data are assigned to the state
						of a transit agency's mailing address.  Details may not add to
						totals due to rounding. Light rail includes light rail, street car,
						and hybrid rail modes. Motorbus includes motorbus, commuter bus, and
						bus rapid transit. Other includes automated guideway, cable car,
						demand response, ferry boat, inclined plane, monorail, trolley bus,
					and van pool.</dd>

					<dt>Motor Bus Transit Route Milage</dt>
					<dd>2013 motor bus transit route mileage by state, for different
					rights-of-way.</dd>
					<dd>This dataset contains the number of directional route-miles for
						buses in each states, broken down into three different rights-of-way.
						The notes below from the data source explain the different
					rights-of-way and define directional route-miles.</dd>
					<dd>This dataset is selectable in the dropdown data selection menus
					and	displays on the parallel coordinates chart and choropleth.</dd>
					<dd>Accessed at: <a href="https://www.bts.gov/content/motor-bus-transit-route-mileage">
					bts.gov</a></dd>
					<dd>Notes from source: Motor bus includes commuter bus, bus, bus rapid
						transit, and trolleybus. Directional route-miles is the mileage in
						each direction over which public transportation vehicles travel while
						in revenue service.  Directional route-miles are a measure of the
						facility or roadway, not the service carried on the facility, such as
						the number of routes or vehicle-miles.  Directional route-miles are
						computed with regard to direction of service, but without regard to
						the number of traffic lanes or rail tracks existing in the
						right-of-way. Exclusive right-of-way refers to lanes reserved at all
						times for transit use and other high occupancy vehicles (HOVs).
						Controlled right-of-way refers to lanes restricted for at least a
						portion of the day for use by transit vehicles and other HOVs. Mixed
						right-of-way refers to lanes used for general automobile traffic.
						Route-miles are assigned to the state of the transit agency's
					headquarters.</dd>

			<h1>Task Analysis</h1>
			<p><em>Task Table</em></p>
			<table style="width:100%">
				<tr>
					<th>Domain Task</th>
					<th>Query</th>
					<th>Search</th>
					<th>Analyze</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>How do Chester Square residents use public transit (bus and T) and
					private vehicles, and is their experience positive or negative?</td>
					<td>Summarize</td>
					<td>Lookup</td>
					<td>Present</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>How does Boston's public transportation usage compare to Massachusetts
					overall and to other states?</td>
					<td>Compare</td>
					<td>Lookup</td>
					<td>Present</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Is there any pattern among states in terms of the proportion of
						commuters who use public transit, the proportion of transit ridership
						attributable to buses, and the proportion of directional bus
					route-miles with different rights-of-way?</td>
					<td>Compare</td>
					<td>Local</td>
					<td>Present</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<dd>For the first task, we will lookup the results we got from our serveys and 
				summarize it. Our goal is to find our how the experience for use of private vehicles
				and public transport is like in ChesterSquare. In the servey, we asked 
				the frequency for both methods of traveling, and some satisfaction question 
			about public transport. Thus, we can use those data to make analysis and conclude the result.</dd>
			<dd>For the second task, we will analyize the serveys results we got and other
				datasets we got from research, and put it side by side to compare. Although some
				of the data from survey can not be compared directly with other datasets, we can
				still make some good conlusion out of it. Using parallel coordinates can help 
				comparing share of public transport usage between states. The goal is to compare 
				data from Boston with other region, so that we can conclude the performance of public 
			transport in Boston</dd>
			<dd>For the third task, we will local the columns from datasets make visualization
				from them. From the visualizations, we can summerize the pattern and compare between
				states. We will also use parallel coordinates to compare those paterns since the 
				parallel coordinates can help tell teh difference easily. The goal is to indentify 
			difference between Boston and other states by comparing them.</dd>
			<p>TODO: add discussion / explanation, fill out table.</p>

			<p>
				<em>Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and
				abstract tasks for domain problems.</em>
			</p>

			<h1>Design Process</h1>

			<p>
				<em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em>
			</p>

			<p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
				Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
			Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>


			<h1>Conclusion</h1>

			<p><em>Short summary of work completed and areas for
			improvement/future-work.</em></p>

			<p><em>Expectation: Meaningfully wraps up project and has good future
			directions.</em></p>
